Target APIs
===========
This is the API description for the target tools (up- and download of data to
MCU using different interfaces). See also the individual tools above and
:ref:`command_line_tools`.

The :class:`Target` class defines an interface that is implemented by all the
Target connections described here. This interface could be used for example in
custom programming tools or testing equipment in manufacturing.

        :param ignore_answer: If set to true enables a mode where answers are not read.

        Open given serial port (pySerial).

        When ``ignore_answer`` is enabled, no answer will be read for any
        command. Instead a small delay will be made. This can be used for
        targets where only the TX line is connected.  However no upload and or
        verification of downloaded data is possible.

    .. method:: close()

        Close serial port

    .. method:: bsl(cmd, message='', expect=None)

        :raises bsl.BSLTimeout: If no answer was received within time

        Implement the low level transmit-receive operation for BSL commands
        over the serial port. The ``cmd`` is filled in the data header,
        ``message`` appended and the checksum calculated for the sent packet.

        Received answers are checked. If ``expect`` is set a data reply must be
        received and its length must match the given number, otherwise a
        :exc:`bsl.BSLError` is raised.

        :param baudrate: New speed (e.g. 38400)

        Send the change baud rate command and if successful change the baud
        rate of the serial port to the same value.

    .. method::: start_bsl()

        Generate the pulse pattern on RST and TEST/TCK that starts the ROM-BSL.


.. class:: SerialBSLTarget(SerialBSL, msp430.target.Target)

    Combine the serial BSL backend and the common target code.

    .. method:: add_extra_options()

        Adds extra options to configure the serial port and the usage of the
        control lines for RST and TEST/TCK.

    .. method:: parse_extra_options()

        Used to output additional tool version info.

    .. method:: close_connection()

        Close serial port.

    .. method:: open_connection()

        Open serial port, using the options from the command line (in
        :attr:`options`). This will also execute the mass erase command
        and/or transmit the password so that executing other actions
        is possible.

        This is also the place to download replacement BSL or the patch.

    .. method:: BSL_TXBLK

        Override the block write function to activate the patch if needed.

    .. method:: BSL_RXBLK

        Override the block read function to activate the patch if needed.

    .. method:: reset()

        Override the reset methods to use the RST control line signal (instead
        of the WDT access)

``msp430.jtag.profile``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. module:: msp430.jtag.profile

Statistical profiler for the MSP430.

It works by sampling the address bus and counting addresses seen.  The problem
there is, that it is not sure that we're reading a valid address every time. An
other issue is the relatively slow sampling rate compared to the execution
speed of the MCU, which means that several runs are need to get meaningful
numbers.

This module can be executed as command line tool (``python -m
msp430.jtag.profile``).

.. note:: This module is currently only supported with parallel port JTAG adapters and MSP430mspgcc.dll/so

.. function:: main()

    Command line frontend. It connects to a target using JTAG. It then samples the
    address bus as fast as possible (which is still much slower that the
    typical CPU speed). When the tool is aborted with ``CTRL+C``, it outputs a
    list of addresses and the number of samples that were hit.

    The idea is that the data can be used to create a statistical analysis of
    code coverage and usage.

    There are a number of problems, so this tool has to be considered as
    experimental:

    - Sampling is relatively slow.
    - There is no guarantee that the value read from the address bus is
      correct. Samples may occur when the CPU is altering the value.
    - There is no difference between instruction fetch and data access.

        have been written!). The contents may span multiple (existing)
        segments.

    .. method:: merge(other)

        :param other: A Memory instance, its contents is copied to this instance.

        Merge an other memory object into this one. The data is merged: in case

Each module provides such a function:

.. function:: label_address_map(filename)

    :param filename: Name of a listing or map file.
    :return: A dictionary mapping labels (key) to addresses (values/int).


File format handlers
====================

Overview
--------
The file format handler modules each provides a load and/or save function on
module level.

.. function:: load(filelike)

    :param filelike: A file like object that is used to write the data.
    :return: :class:`msp430.memory.Memory` instance with the contents loaded from the fike like object.

    Read from a file like object and fill in the contents to a memory object.
    The file like should typically be a file opened for reading in binary
    mode.

.. function:: save(memory, filelike)

    :param memory: :class:`msp430.memory.Memory` instance with the contents loaded from the fike like object.
    :param filelike: A file like object that is used to write the data.

    Write the contents of the memory object to the given file like object. This
    should typically be a file opened for writing in binary mode.

Handlers
--------
``msp430.memory.bin``

    .. module:: msp430.memory.bin

    Load and save binary data. Note that this is not practical for MSP430 binaries
    as they usually are not one block and do not start at address null. The binary
    format can not keep track of addresses.

``msp430.memory.elf``

    ELF object file reader (typical file extension ``.elf``). There is
    currently no support for writing this type.

``msp430.memory.hexdump``

    Read and write hex dumps.

``msp430.memory.titext``

    Read and write TI-text format files (often named ``.txt``).

``msp430.memory.intelhex``

    Read and write Intel-HEX format files (often named ``.a43``).
